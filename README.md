# 06 Project Weather Dashboard

# Description
A simple weather dashboard that allows the user to input a city or select a previously searched city. The website will display the current weather and a 5 day forecast.

`There is currently a bug with the search and history feature. When clicked, the correct title is shown but the previous city's weather data is displayed. When the page is then refreshed, the correct data is displayed`
